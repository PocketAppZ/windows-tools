OPTIMIZE.CMD (right-click and run as administrator!), downloads and runs Optimize, a Powershell 
script which downloads and runs several Powershell applets from a CDD private repository at 
LiquidWeb.  These perform a much deeper filesystem cleanup than CCleaner, two different VSS 
cleanup steps, a thorough shutoff of consumer email and gaming items in Windows 10, several 
NTFS items for SSD TRIM, performance, and corruption prevention, and other items.  
Requires Powershell 4.0.  

GETREDISTS.CMD (also right-click and run as administrator), installs and/or updates all 
currently-supported versions of the Microsoft VC++ library, on which a great many applications depend.  
It knocks out mystery applications crashes of many sorts, and can provide a general quiet 
reliability boost.  It requires Powershell 5.1.  Also needs to be run as administrator.

Powershell 5.1 used to be installable on Windows 7, possibly not anymore.
